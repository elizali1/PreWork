        <p>Where to start..</p>
        <p>One of my goals for this year, other than exceling in Per Scholas and starting my career in tech, is to try at least one different resturant, cafe or bar a month. While having lived in New York for most of my life, I never really explored what was out here until this year. They say it's better late than never right.. right?</p>
        <p>With that being said, if anyone has any recommendations, favorites, or would even like to tag along, let me know!
